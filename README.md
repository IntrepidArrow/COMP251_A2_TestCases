![Second MST](https://github.com/tomsarry/COMP251_A2_TestCases/blob/master/Kruskal's%20Algorithm/Tree2.PNG?raw=true)
No explanation on website, had to derive the MST by myself.
_**Note:** Second tree has two solutions for the last edge -> I added 2 different result files to account for this, if you result if any of these, you should be fine._
